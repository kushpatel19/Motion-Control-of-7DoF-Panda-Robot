# Motion-Control-of-7DoF-Panda-Robot

## Project Overview
The "Motion-Control-of-7DoF-Panda-Robot" project focuses on executing a real-world manipulation task using the 7 Degrees of Freedom (7DoF) Franka Emika Panda robotic manipulator in simulation. This project is divided into two parts: analysis and simulation of the manipulator, and the development of an environment and implementation of a manipulation task.

## Introduction
The main focus of this project is to perform a detailed analysis and simulation of a robotic manipulator, and then develop an environment to execute a manipulation task using the Franka Emika Panda robot. We have used Coppelia Sim for simulation and MATLAB for analysis and task implementation.

## Project Parts

### Part 1: Analysis and Simulation
1. **Manipulator Selection**: We selected the 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robotic manipulator, known for its dexterity and versatility.
2. **Literature Survey**: A comprehensive literature survey was conducted to establish the motivation and significance of the chosen manipulator.
3. **Analytical Analysis**:
   - **Task Representation**
   - **Position Analysis**
   - **Velocity and Statics Analysis**
   - **Redundancy Resolution**
   - **Stiffness Analysis**
   - **Dynamics Analysis**
   - Tools used: MATLAB for symbolic computation and plotting.
4. **Simulation Development**: An existed model of the manipulator was used in Coppelia Sim. Various simulations were performed to validate the manipulator's capabilities.

### Part 2: Environment Development and Task Implementation
1. **Task Definition**: Defined the manipulation task for the Panda robot.
2. **Motion Control**: Developed a motion control strategy for the robot using MATLAB.
3. **Simulation and Analysis**: Detailed formulation and analysis of the robotâ€™s dynamics were performed.
4. **Report and Media**: A PDF report elaborating the task and its execution was created. 

## Features
- **Robust Analysis**: Comprehensive position, velocity, statics, and dynamics analysis.
- **Motion Control Implementation**: Effective motion control strategy implemented using MATLAB.
- **Documentation**: Well-documented reports and code files for easy understanding and replication.
